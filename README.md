# Instructions for running this code - 

### 1. Please run the code cells one after the other in the order I have written them.

### 2. If you run this notebook in one go, you might face some errors because I have included snippets of some failed attempts to show the methods I tried which didn't work. In that case, please run the code from the next code cell.

### 3. You will find some **data visualizations** in between the questions that have been asked. I have **done those voluntarily** to have a deeper insight into the dataset to eventually help me better design the Machine Learning model.

### 4. The **Machine Learning model** is being trained on **A100 GPU** from **Google Colab**.

### 5. The **References** for the code and libraries used are mentioned at the **end of this notebook**.
